# Why Python?

Python is:
* the fourth most popular programming language<sup>[1],[7],[9]</sup>;
* out of the twelve most popular languages, the most 'loved' by developers<sup>[2]</sup>;
* the fourth most desired programming language for developers to use<sup>[2]</sup>;
* the fourth most active language on Stack Overflow<sup>[3]</sup>; and
* the most Googled programming language for tutorials<sup>[8]</sup>.

It promotes itself<sup>[11]</sup> as:
* having an easy-to-read and elegant syntax;
* being an easy-to-use language;
* having a large standard library; and
* being able to run anywhere.

Working in our geospatial organsation, Python has a particular relevance, because:
* it is in the top two most popular programming language for handling Maths and Data<sup>[4],[12]</sup>;
* it can be used to control ESRI's ArcGIS tools<sup>[5]</sup>;
* it is used inside Safe's FME<sup>[6]</sup>; and 
* it has good bindings for [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)<sup>[10]</sup>.
* it is compatible with Databricks (though Scala fits a bit better)
