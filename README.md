# Why Python?

Python is:
* the sixth most popular programming language<sup>[1],[7],[9]</sup>;
* out of the twelve most popular languages, the most 'loved' by developers<sup>[2]</sup>;
* the fourth most desired programming language for developers to use<sup>[2]</sup>;
* the fourth most active language on Stack Overflow<sup>[3]</sup>; and
* the second most Googled programming language for tutorials, behind Java<sup>[8]</sup>.

It promotes itself<sup>[11]</sup> as:
* having an easy-to-read elegant syntax;
* being easy-to-use language;
* having a large standard library that includes web servers, regular expressions, reading and modifying files; and
* being able to run anywhere.

Working in our geospatial organsation, Python has a particular relevance, because:
* it is the most popular programming language for handling Maths and Data<sup>[4]</sup>;
* it can be used to control ESRI's ArcGIS tools<sup>[5]</sup>;
* it is used inside Safe's FME<sup>[6]</sup>; and 
* it has good bindings for [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)<sup>[10]</sup>.
